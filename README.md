# Animal Simulation

Basic Simulation of animals eating food, allowing some basic customization and a graph of animals moving and eating food. 
Handles things like multiple animals trying to eat one food. Prints most information on a round-per-round basis, as nicely as the Java console allows for formatting.

Finished 12/23/2023, but I could definitely do more...
